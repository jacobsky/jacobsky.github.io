Welcome to my little slice of the web.

I am Jacobsky, and I am a software developer working out of Tokyo, Japan. This website is my personal website and is generally about game-dev and programming, but may fall into any topic that I feel like writing about.

If you can find me on social media, I will actually be pretty surprised :D
