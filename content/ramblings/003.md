As a hobby, I enjoy game-dev, but one of the things that I've been struggling with lately is burnout on working on my main game. Over the last year, I've found that refactors and gui development tend to be the biggest period of burnout as neither are really something that I enjoy. 

For reference, [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/) is a super comfy couch of a game that I periodically relapse into and grind a bunch of stuff. The game has some sparks of brilliance, but it usually just a comfy gear grinding game.

Now the question is "How do I not burn out?" and I ended up finding the solution in just "working on other things". Since I started helping to contribute and then maintaining godot-rust, I've found it a lot easier to stick with development. Having others in the same position has helped me to prevent burning out and at least work on things that are tangential to my project while I think about how I can reimplement/refactor my game.

This doesn't make relapsing into Warframe any less likely, but at least it keeps me on track :D
