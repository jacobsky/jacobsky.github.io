One thing that I've been itching to share is some of my findings when working with ECS (more specifically with `godot-rust`), so I'm happy to mention that there is a new `articles` section that I created for this site. These are much more curated than the ramblings, so I'm trying to keep the typos down and the quality up.

That is not a priority for the ramblings.
