Lately, I've found myself spending considerably more time working on open-source projects rather than my own personal projects. As a relative newcomer to maintaining open source projects, I have been spending a lot more time thinking about how we can strike a proper balance during my very limited free hours.

While the other maintainers and contributors continue to focus on improving godot-rust from a technical perspective (adding async, serialization, bugfixes), I find myself spending a lot more time on the "guidance and documentation" part of the project. There's been a large personal benefit to writing the godot-rust/book. I get the opportunity to learn a large amount about the framework while also helping out future new users in the community. This in addition to systematizing some of the github issues to at least point out that they should take a look at the FAQ, may help, but only time will tell.

One part of this adventure that I did not account for was how much community maintenance can come along with being a maintainer. I definitely have a much bigger appreciation for what the Godot Devs go through with a substantially bigger project. I'm already a little overwhelmed by the 300 members of the discord :D.

Anyways, this is quite an adventure to look forward to.
