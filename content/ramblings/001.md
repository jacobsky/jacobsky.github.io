This is my dev-blog, this is my collection of ramblings about anything and everything related to my ideas around game-dev/web-dev/whatever I fancy.

I may also create separate dev-blogs for ideas specifically surrounding projects that I am working on/a such as my own games and [godot-rust](www.github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust).
