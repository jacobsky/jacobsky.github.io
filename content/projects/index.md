I am a hobby game developer and an avid fan of Rust. Currently, I contribute to the following projects:

## [godot-rust](https://www.github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust)

I am one of the maintainers on the godot-rust team. My main point of focus is maintaining the [godot-rust book](https://www.github.com/godot-rust/book) and helping to review PRs and other issues that crop up in the project. I am also pretty active in the godot-rust discord.

## [godot-egui](https://www.github.com/setzer22/godot-egui)

I've been working with Setzer22 to create a Godot integrations for [egui](https://www.github.com/emilk/egui).

## [egui-stylist](https://www.github.com/jacobsky/egui-stylist)

This was born out of a need to have a reproducible theme for use with [godot-egui](https://www.github.com/setzer22/godot-egui).

## Unnamed RPG

I am also working on a tactics RPG. I don't have anything public to share on this yet, but it's been a very fun project that leverages a lot of what I'm doing with godot-rust. Once I'm ready to start sharing progress, I'll add a dev-log section to talk about it.
