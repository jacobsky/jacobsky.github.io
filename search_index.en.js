While migrating to using SPECS helped alleviate many issues and make my architecture more flexible and parallelilzable, the point that I struggled with the most was \"What constitutes a good component design?\".\nAs kyren put so eloquently \"ECS is SQL for games\" and I think this is a good place to start when considering how we should lay out our data. \nNote: This article is in reference to Rust and SPECS Parallel ECS\nIf we think about an ECS World as a database instance, we can see the following:\n\nEntity is a PrimaryKey\nComponent are Tables\nSystem is both the App Logic and the Query logic that uses the Database. This often makes use of copious table joins to work with various data.\n\nStructuring Component Data\nIn most Rust based ECS all of our components are stored as structs and it is possible to put any data that you want into it.\nFor example, when working with rendering/spatial data we could write the Transform3D structs as either:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Transform3D {\n    position: (f32, f32, f32),\n    rotation: (f32, f32, f32),\n    scale: (f32, f32, f32),\n}\n// Alternatively \n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Transform3D {\n    position_x: f32\n    position_y: f32\n    position_z: f32\n    //\n    rotation_x: f32\n    rotation_y: f32\n    rotation_z: f32\n    //\n    scale_x: f32\n    scale_y: f32\n    scale_z: f32\n}\n\nFundamentally, these are the same data, just layed out in slightly different ways. There may be some differences in the performance characteristics, but that requires profiling.\nFrom an architectural standpoint, this does mean that it is not possible to have an entity with a Transform3D that only represents position.\nIf you want to make it so that the various portions are optional, you need to take one of two approaches.\nMaking each part internally optional:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Transform3D {\n    position: Option&lt;(f32, f32, f32)&gt;,\n    rotation: Option&lt;(f32, f32, f32)&gt;,\n    scale: Option&lt;(f32, f32, f32)&gt;,\n}\n\nOr representing them as separate components:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Position3D {\n    x: f32,\n    y: f32,\n    z: f32,\n}\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Rotation3D {\n    x: f32,\n    y: f32,\n    z: f32,\n}\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Scale3D {\n    x: f32,\n    y: f32,\n    z: f32,\n}\n\nNote: this is a trivial example that is intended to clearly demonstrate some different ways to organize the same data. You should evaluate each approach to ensure that it has the necessary performance characteristics for your game.\nA more complex example of something that you might need to work with in ECS is an inventory system.\nIf items in your game are relatively simple and don't require complex data, you could probably make an inventory system work pretty easily with something like the following:\nenum ItemKind {\n    A, B, C, D\n}\n\nstruct InventoryItem {\n    kind: ItemKind,\n    quantity: i32\n}\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Inventory {\n    items: Vec&lt;InventoryItem&gt;\n}\n\nThere are some additional changes that you could also make to allow for more configurable kinds of items, but the assumption in the above code is that Inventory Items are not entities and cannot exist in the world.\nWhat if we want to allow items to also be entities. This may be useful for games with a much higher degree of simulation, e.g. Clockwork games like Hitman where items can also exist in the world and may have many types of possible interactions.\nAnother advantage is that rather than always duplicating the item information, it would be possible to organize the items as references to other items.\nOne way to handle this would be to change the inventory from InventoryItem to Entity like:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Inventory {\n    items: Vec&lt;Entity&gt;\n}\n\nThen we can define any data on our item entity that we want. We can also create separate components to indicate stackability, add description information, etc.\nBut there's a problem with this solution. In case you didn't catch it, this allows for any Inventory to store any Entity and it is possible for the same Entity to be stored in two separate Inventorys. One option is to manually check every inventory to ensure that an Entity isn't stored else-where (this is a bad idea as it is super performance intensive).\nAs this highlights a common issue with ECS, I'm going to spoil it for you a bit. This is the \"relational\" part of relational database.\nComponent Relationships\nSomething that we can use as a bit of a guide when considering this is Database Normalization, in particular, Third Normal Form which creates the following constraints with regard to table design.\nConstraintECS Equivalent\nPrimary keyEntity\nAtomic columns where cells cannot have tables as valuesComponents cannot have properties that are also Components\nEvery non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary keyNo struct should be dependent upon more than the Entity itself\nNo non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary keyDon't make tables that both depend on another Entity and contain duplicate data from the entity\n\nNow this is a rough guide on the translation between the two. In 99% of cases, common sense will keep your data conforming with 3NF as structuring your data often wouldn't make any sense otherwise.\nThe next step is to determine the actual relationships that we need to create.\nConsidering the inventory example:\nAn inventory can have 0 or more entities, but an entity can only belong to a single entity. As such we can identify that this is a one to many relationship. While the previous option technically models this. It is more convenient to model it in reverse.\n/// This component will add any entity. It is the system's responsibility for ensuring that the \n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct StoredInContainer {\n    stored_in: Entity\n}\n\n// This is any entity that can act as a container. NullStorage allows us to effectively create a `Table` with only a single column.\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[storage(NullStorage)]\nstruct InventoryContainer;\n\nUsing specs we can create the relationship between two entities in the following code:\nlet world = World::new();\nlet inventory = world.create_entity()\n    // Add other data of interest\n    .with(InventoryContainer{})\n    .build();\nlet item = world.create_entity()\n    // Add other data of interest\n    .with(Storage)\n    .with(StoredInContainer { stored_in: inventory })\n    .build();\n\nOne point that may confuse some newer developers is how you can figure out which entity owns a given item.\nThe general answer is that you would do a join across the Entity table checking whether the StoredInContainer entity refers to the entity in question. There may be some additional optimizations that you can look into, but as most Iventory look up would happen relatively infrequently.\nIn specs this looks like:\n// Assume that you have an entity named entity_with_inventory\nlet entities = world.entities();\nlet stored_in_container();\n\nlet entities : Vec&lt;Entity&gt; = (&amp;entities, &amp;stored_in_containers)\n    .join()\n    .filter(|(_entity, stored)|{ entity_with_inventory == stored_in_container.stored_in})\n    .map(|entity, _stored| entity)\n    .collect();\n\n","id":"https://jacobsky.github.io/articles/001-ecs-component-design/","title":"How do design your ECS components."},"https://jacobsky.github.io/articles/002-ecs-with-godot-rust/":{"body":"Note: This article is still a work in progress.\nIf you've read the godot-rust book's Chapter on Game Architecture, you may have some questions about how this could work with ECS.\nThe basic answer is going to be based on option #3.
